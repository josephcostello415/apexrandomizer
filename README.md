# Apex Randomizer Discord Bot
The genisis of this bot came from a friend who wanted to create a bot that gives a random starting location on an Apex Legends map as a place to land, to keep the game feeling fresh. 
From there, we expanded the idea to include a randomized weapon loadout, as well as a stat lookup using the tracker.gg

This bot was coded by myself, using Discord.py and Python 3.8.6
